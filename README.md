# README

This README would normally document whatever steps are necessary to get the
application up and running.

Things you may want to cover:

* Ruby version - 2.3.3

* I have provided basic login from google and normal sign in sign up flow.

* Every user can sign in and generate short URLs for any given URL.

* URLs can be same for different users but not same for one user. In that case the  short URL wont be generated again.

* On login the user will land to a page where it will ask for URL to be shortened.
  Once the user enters the URL he/she will be redirected to a page where the short url will be shown.

* On seeing the short url you can come back to previous page where all the URLS the particular user has generated will be shown in tabular format.

* Not clear with the API part so was not able to implement only the API part.
